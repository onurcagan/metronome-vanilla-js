This is a simple metronome web app created for personal use. It provides a straightforward interface for controlling the tempo of the metronome. Here's a brief overview of the app:

### Features

#### v1.0.0
- Adjustable tempo ranging from 40 BPM to 200 BPM.
- Start/Stop button to control the metronome.
- Visual tempo display.
- Clean and minimalistic design.

#### v1.1.0

- Manual input through UI is now also an option.

#### v1.2.0
- Reworked UI to show my love of black & red combo and move the Start button to the bottom.
- Changed Oscillator Node Type to triangle from sine which I feel is more fitting for a metronome.
